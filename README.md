# Ultrasonic Servo Scanner with LCD

This Arduino project uses an ultrasonic sensor, a servo motor, and a 16x2 LCD to detect nearby objects and display distance in real-time.
Feel free to modify variables and pins depending on your project/design

### Features:
- Servo sweeps back and forth
- Ultrasonic sensor detects objects
- LCD displays distance or "Nothing detected"
- Buzzer and LEDs give feedback (Use 220 ohm resistors for LED)

### Hardware:
- Arduino Mega2560
- HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
- SG90 servo motor
- 16x2 LCD with potentiometer
- LEDs, buzzer, jumper wires
